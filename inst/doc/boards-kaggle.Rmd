```

## Registering

In order to use Kaggle as a [board](boards-understanding.html), you need to authenticate first by creating a token file from [kaggle.com/me/account](https://www.kaggle.com/me/account). 

```{r eval=FALSE}
board_register_kaggle(token = "path/to/kaggle.json")
```

Notice that `board_register_kaggle()` is just an alias with named parameters to `board_register()`; the previous code is equivalent to:

```{r eval=FALSE}
board_register("kaggle", token = "path/to/kaggle.json")
```

Once the board is registered, you can pin and search using `pin()`, `pin_get()` and `pin_find()`.

## Pinning

Like in other boards, you can create pins for `iris` and `mtcars` by setting `board` to Kaggle's board name,

```{r eval=FALSE}
pin(iris, description = "The iris data set", board = "kaggle")
pin(mtcars, description = "The motor trend cars data set", board = "kaggle")
```

After a pin is created, the pin also becomes available in the Kaggle's dataset website; by defeault, they are created as private datasets.

You can also retrieve pins back from this repo using the now familiar `pin_get()` function. However, since Kaggle names require at least six characters, `pins` appends `-pin` to names that are shorter than Kaggle's required size.

```{r eval=FALSE}
pin_get("iris-pin", board = "kaggle")
```
```

## Discovering

You can then search pins in your repo using `pin_find()`, which by default search all boards but you can also explicitly request to use this particular Kaggle board:

```{r eval=FALSE}
pin_find("motor", board = "kaggle")
```
```

Notice that the given 'motor' search keyword is searched in the name and description fields for the pins available in this repo.

## Sharing

When working in teams, you might want to share your pins with others. For Kaggle boards, this is accomplished by adding users or making the dataset public through Kaggle's website.

Once you share with specific users, they can follow the same steps to register a Kaggle board which allows them to download pins shared with them or upload their own pins.
